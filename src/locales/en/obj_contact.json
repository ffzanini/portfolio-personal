The visuals, layout, content, navigation… everything has been enthusiastically praised. Even my father, who took a look at the code, said it was 'clean' — which coming from him, is a huge compliment! On launch day alone, we had over 1,000 visitors! I’ve received individual messages highlighting the organization, clarity, and identity of DOVE, which has become even stronger with our online presence. I’m deeply grateful for the work of everyone involved. Without a doubt, a success!",

He cares about all aspects of the development process, not limiting himself to just coding. In the projects we worked on together, he performed very well as a tech lead with the client, managing to deliver outstanding results with the team. He communicates effectively and knows how to handle tough situations. Felipe learns technical concepts quickly and has great autonomy to lead any project.",
